Pure JavaScript libraray for parsing LDIF (from LDAP standards)
addressbooks.

It is oriented mostly on impmorting export files from Thunderbird, so
although it tries to adhere to RFC2849 as much as possible, it doesnâ€™t
support:

* changes
* hierarchies
* different schemata
* linked values from files or URLs

Pull requests for full coverage of RFC are more than welcome (with
additional tests)
